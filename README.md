# opaws

The concept behind opaws is simple:
Allow an Amazon Echo to interact over voice with an instance of [openQA](http://open.qa)

## Goals

Allow an Amazon Echo to use OpenQA's API by using intents for common tasks
* Clone jobs from openqa.opensuse.org or openqa.fedoraproject.org
* Control job handling on the openQA instance (Job status and review of a job)
* Get status of a build in openqa.opensuse.org (Through the flash briefing skill)
